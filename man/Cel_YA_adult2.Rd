}
\description{
Reconstructed data from a dataset published by Reinke et al.
Time is in hours, scaled on the Oudenaarden 20C time series.
}
\details{
To obtain this reference, an ICA was performed joining the Oudenaarden and 
Reinke datasets to get clear development dynamics, and interpolation done on the 
28-87h time period. This was necessary as the data is quite old and noisy.
