\description{
Data from a paper published by Hashimshony et al.
with C elegans gene expression levels (log+1 from rpkm) at 
56 time points. The time is in minutes after the 4-cell stage. 
Two timepoints thus have negative times (the 1 and 2-cell stage embryos).
This dataset is a reference time series for C. elegans embryo development at 20C 
from the 1-cell stage to hatching (830min).
